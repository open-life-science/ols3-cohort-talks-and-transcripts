00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Unknown: So, official Welcome to
open Life Science from my side

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,750
as well, very excited to have
you all on the call, I'll give

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,630
you a very quick overview of
what this program is about and

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,950
what you will be learning.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,340
So you met Bernie's, and you and
me, we are the organizers of

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,450
this program. And we will always
have me in the call who will be

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,010
co hosting this with us.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,890
So as a team, we believe that to
be effective, science should be

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,800
shared openly with others and
made freely available.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,080
And you're here with us to do
similar amount of work that we

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,070
have planned for you. And we
have also done in our program.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,580
We're here to share what we have
learned and we hope that you

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,930
will find them useful.

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,210
The open Life Science program
has been designed to help early

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,960
stage researcher and potential
academic leaders to become open

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,350
sense ambassadors, maybe this is
a bit outdated, because we've

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,380
seen a lot more different
varieties of project coming to

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,640
the program. And a lot of you
are probably not academic or

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,940
early career researchers. So
please don't think that this is

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,120
very much limited to this
definition anymore.

21
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,580
So again, we think that science
can advance only we share our

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,590
work with other and not, NOT
gate keep it or compete for

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,690
knowledge that others can
benefit from.

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,400
But often, researchers are very
skeptical about sharing their

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,790
work due to their fear of
getting scooped being criticized

26
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,070
or not knowing what they can or
cannot share. Because often, one

27
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,400
of the rewards that we have in
research is paper and a lot of

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,990
papers are tend to be novel. So
this novelty often reduces the

29
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,780
chances of people sharing work
from the beginning as they're

30
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,500
developing.

31
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,800
In this program, we will discuss
how to work openly without

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,850
becoming scientific vulnerable.
What we would like to do is to

33
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,110
share information around how you
can own the work that you've

34
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,020
done, but at the same time, be
collaborative and open your

35
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,390
project for others to come along
and work with you.

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,730
And together, we will explore
the important concepts in open

37
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,750
science and apply them in our
work one step at a time. Our

38
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,200
cohort calls are organized every
second week, but you will have

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,290
one week breather period where
you will have a chance to apply

40
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,770
the topics that you'll learn
about, apply them in your work,

41
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,850
talk to your mentors, but also
have a chance to talk about

42
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,010
those in slack or on GitHub
issue tracker that we will share

43
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,690
towards the end of this call.

44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,410
So this is something that is
just a reminder, because you all

45
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,620
know it's a 15 week long
Mentorship Program, which ends

46
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,670
with one week of graduation.
With people finishing and

47
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,250
sharing about what they have
worked on you will be attending

48
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,460
cohort based training. If you
can't attend it, you will be

49
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,930
able to access all the notes and
videos on YouTube. And you will

50
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,070
be able to talk to us a week
later in an open office hour to

51
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,350
discuss any topic that you
didn't understand or some

52
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,980
clarification might be useful
for you. We will also give you

53
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,680
lots of assignments. And these
assignments are not to be

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,800
judged. So we want to look at
it, it's really up to you how

55
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,400
you take those assignments and
apply them into your work. So

56
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,270
it's a lot of reflective and
experiential learning for you.

57
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,630
If you are really, really
excited of what we are teaching

58
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,970
you there are a lot more
information out there. And one

59
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,360
of the things that open licenses
built upon is Mozilla open

60
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,960
leadership principle. And all
the materials are online under

61
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,320
CC by so if you feel that you
would like to learn a little bit

62
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,070
more, this is something that you
can always visit, we will also

63
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,810
add the link in the chat for
you.

64
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,380
The idea of open leadership is
that everybody can become open

65
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,560
leader because open leaders are
people who design build and

66
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,250
empower their projects and
communities for understanding

67
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,600
sharing and participation and
inclusion. So, I would like to

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,120
show you this table and this
table is something you will see

69
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,690
quite a lot as we bring expert
speakers and they show you

70
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,250
different topics. So we go
through design, build empower,

71
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,760
and we build for the
understanding, sharing and

72
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,570
participation and inclusion. So
every time we are working and

73
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,330
developing certain aspects of
our project, we need to think

74
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,870
about am I designing it for
people to understand it? Am I

75
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,680
designing it that people can
share or build upon my work is

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,850
it actually participate true
inclusive. So this is a thought

77
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,460
process that we will go one by
one so you don't need to

78
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,030
remember it but this is a
principle that we hope you will

79
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,370
be able to integrate in
everything that you're doing

80
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,750
within open science.

81
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,140
Again, open science is a huge
umbrella term. It can have lots

82
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,970
of topic that you

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,050
isn't just restricted to open
source software or open access

84
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,950
publication. But there's a lot
more about open science that you

85
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,860
might be interested in. So as
you heard everybody have really

86
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,240
diverse ideas. Some of you might
want to share data openly, which

87
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,730
falls into the term open data,
you would like to share your

88
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,820
code, which is open source
software. Some of you have

89
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,690
hardware design, which is open
source hardware. Of course, you

90
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,110
know about papers and protocol,
which can be published in open

91
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,560
access. We also want to
encourage you to share your

92
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,040
results earlier, which is
preprint, sharing prep paper

93
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,060
reviews in open reviews. Many of
you are working on open

94
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,480
education and citizen science.
And we would like to bring you

95
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,180
all together so take the
opportunity to get to know each

96
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,700
other as well, because
scientific networking is also

97
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,050
part of open science.

98
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,510
Open by design is something we
would like you to remember

99
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,750
because open by default is not
often inclusive, or

100
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,680
participatory or community LED.
But when we design them into our

101
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,680
project, we can make sure that
everything that we are doing is

102
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,860
actually built for inclusion and
community.

103
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,610
So one of the studies in 2012,
which had included about 160,

104
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,120
tech companies found that the
level of strategic intent in

105
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,660
openness and not just openness
alone correlates with market

106
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,530
performance.

107
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,360
You can also think about
designing openness into your

108
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,300
work and it shouldn't be a
thoughtless default. This is

109
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,570
something that we want to be
extremely intentional about. And

110
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,720
I think that's what is in the
core of open Life Science

111
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,380
Program.

112
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,440
You all are leaders, and we
believe that with your

113
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,050
leadership and your vision
combined with what we are

114
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,780
teaching in this program, you
can achieve a very positive

115
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,570
cultural change in your
community. And we hope you will

116
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,090
take the chance to exchange
those ideas and thoughts with

117
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,720
each other
