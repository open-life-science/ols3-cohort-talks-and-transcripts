00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
Yo Yehudi: Hello. So hi, I'm here
to talk to you very briefly

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,860
about open licenses. The slides
that I'm sharing are shared with

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,690
a creative commons by license,
developed by open life science

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,370
and then modified by me, I am
not a lawyer, I only play one

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,850
one playing board games. Okay,
so a little bit about me, I am

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,940
the reproducibility librarian at
the Health Science Center

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,690
libraries at the University of
Florida. My pronouns are he him

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,830
his and my Twitter handle is how
and why do you feel free to

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,920
reach out to me if you have
questions about research,

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,640
reproducibility or other related
topics. So the goal and talking

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,100
about licensing in the context
of open life science is an open

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,790
projects is we would like other
people to be able to use, remix,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,320
and share our the work that
we're doing in our open

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,930
projects. And we achieve that by
making sure that we have in our

15
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,010
open projects, explicit
documentation about how other

16
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,640
people can use and remix and
share it. And so we're going to

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,180
go through these slides. And
hopefully, if there's time, you

18
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,930
know, have the ability to have
short discussion or answer any

19
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,890
quick questions about this, with
the goal being that you will

20
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,590
eventually know and understand
the importance, and how exactly

21
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:44,250
to do the task of adding an open
license to your work. Okay. And

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,140
so going back to kind of the
intent behind all of this, the

23
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,680
open leadership framework talks
about open leaders, as designing

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,370
and building projects that
empower others, right, we think

25
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,240
about, were doing these
projects, because usually,

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,960
because we care about doing work
that, you know, helps other

27
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,480
people, whether those are people
in our communities or outside

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,550
our communities. And so that's
kind of where we think about one

29
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:18,240
way in which, you know, we do
that interaction is by having

30
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,450
our work be shared in a way that
other people can, can use it.

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,190
And so this falls in this box of
the open leadership framework of

32
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,180
building for sharing and making
sure that we have explicitly in

33
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,280
the building of our project, a
way that we share the work.

34
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,930
Okay, so some some
misconceptions that I think I

35
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,490
want to address when talking
about licensing. Because it is a

36
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,430
it is a complex topic, and it
does relate to things like

37
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,040
copyright, and academic credit.
But licensing is not the same

38
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,570
thing. And so some brief kind of
points to make really quickly,

39
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,740
just because you share something
on the internet, or GitHub or

40
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,350
someone else share something on
the internet, or GitHub does not

41
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,480
automatically allow other people
to use it. If you are sharing

42
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,800
work with a license, it does not
by default, give away your

43
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,360
copyright. So you can share work
with a free license and an open

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,920
license like Creative Commons,
that does not prevent you from

45
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,880
publishing your work or selling
your work or in other ways

46
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,100
monetizing your work. And
finally, a work that has been

47
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,700
shared with an open license, you
can use it and other people can

48
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,190
use it, they don't have to cite
you necessarily. So it can be

49
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,670
legal to use the work without
citing you. But in an academic

50
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,090
setting, if you are doing an
academic research, that's still

51
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,050
considered a violation of
academic ethics. And that is

52
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,460
something that you would pursue
if it's a problem using academic

53
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:10,350
means. Because that can be
plagiarism. Okay, so some some

54
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,350
kind of common elements. When we
talk about licenses, there are

55
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,540
of course, many different ways
you can, you can give other

56
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,980
people permissions on so many
different example licenses. And

57
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,790
the kinds of things that we
think about in terms of

58
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,320
including in the open license
are how people can use your

59
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,460
work, how people can modify your
work, and how they can share

60
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,460
your work and redistribute
either the original or the

61
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,530
modified work to other people.
And so, yeah,

62
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,670
some of these elements also
include attribution. So a lot of

63
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:56,250
the open licenses that are in
use gela require that if the

64
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,300
work is being reshare by someone
else, that the job Original

65
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,740
authors are credited. So
examples of this are the

66
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,730
Creative Commons by license,
which has a this attribution

67
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,420
clause, and almost all the other
licenses that will be mentioned

68
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,130
today. And one exception to this
one important exception to this

69
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,450
is the Creative Commons zero
license, which effectively is

70
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:26,040
putting something into the
public domain and waiving your

71
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,870
copyright to, to whatever it is
that you are sharing using the

72
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:38,640
CC zero license. So some some
kind of advance advanced

73
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,510
complications within this topic
of open license. So I've put

74
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,650
these as I list these as
wrinkles, because they are

75
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:55,170
relevant to kind of consider,
but maybe don't think too much

76
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,440
about making sure you understand
all the details of it. Open

77
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,670
licenses have this distinction
between what we call copyleft

78
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,380
and non copyleft. licenses,
which basically have to do with

79
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,200
whether modifications of a work
have to be shared under the same

80
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,800
principles. The idea with the
copyleft licenses. So something

81
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,290
like the GNU Public License, the
GPL is that if someone writes a

82
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,350
piece of software and shares it
with that license, a company

83
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,180
can't just build off of that
software, and then sell their

84
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,380
modifications, they also have to
distribute their modifications

85
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,740
in the same license. And that
way, if there's a way of

86
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,820
ensuring that kind of, if you're
going to use something in the

87
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,130
copyleft world, that you also
contribute to that world. And

88
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:55,230
this is not true for licenses
that are permissive, but not in

89
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,450
the copyleft scheme. And we
generally prefer those in the

90
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,980
kind of open licensing world.
And I think for, you know, open

91
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,460
life science, we don't
necessarily want to be overly

92
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,170
restrictive with how people can
reuse our work. But that is if

93
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,990
that is something that is
important to you, that is

94
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:23,370
something to consider. The next
thing is that patents are also

95
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,480
not related to copyright, which
are not are not the same thing

96
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,380
as licensing. So copyright
rights include the ability to

97
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,520
copy, modify, and redistribute
work. And patent rights include

98
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,780
the ability to use make and sell
work. And so this generally

99
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,920
tends to come up when you're
talking about software, in that

100
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,240
open source licenses for
software may or may not

101
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:53,940
explicitly include something
that grants patent rights. And

102
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,810
this is a whole big can of
worms. So I'll just say if you

103
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,890
are writing software, and you
have a plan to patch the

104
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:06,930
software in any way, definitely
talk to a lawyer before thinking

105
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,320
before just slapping an open
license and expecting that your

106
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:18,510
patent rights will be preserved.
Okay, that was a lot. So let's

107
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:23,160
go into the the kind of details
of how you go about applying the

108
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,920
license. So a license file is
usually named license in all

109
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,310
caps, and it goes in the root
directory or the top most folder

110
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:39,240
of your project. And you can
definitely include multiple

111
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,690
licenses. And that's important
because you might have different

112
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,440
components of your project that
you want to apply different

113
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,130
licenses to. And that's kind of
important because licenses that

114
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:56,130
are best for software are not
ideal for content, like images

115
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,420
or writing, and in the reverse
as well. And so there are ways

116
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,690
that you can specify in the
license section of your README,

117
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,460
or the license file exactly
which parts of your project are

118
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:16,530
associated with which license.
So again, data and code and

119
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,980
creative works are not the same
thing. And so you may require

120
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,460
different licenses on here's an
interesting tweet I saw earlier

121
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:29,820
this week about this topic that
is relevant. And so ways that

122
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,990
you can add a license to your
project and GitHub, if you are

123
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,040
creating a new repository and
GitHub, there's a section at the

124
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,360
bottom where you can initialize
the repository by clicking that

125
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,960
checkbox.

126
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,040
And then you can choose a
license from among a number of

127
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,880
built in defaults to GitHub. So
that's a way you can just start

128
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,140
out a project with a license.
But if you already have a

129
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,590
project on GitHub, there's
another way you can add one of

130
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,850
these license templates. Which
is when you use the feature to

131
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,840
add a new file. If you start
typing the file name, license in

132
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,500
all caps, a button pops up,
which lets you choose a licensed

133
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,680
template. And that's also really
handy to have in that, again,

134
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,480
you don't have to go look for
the full text of a license and

135
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,620
get the file. If you're just
working in GitHub. Those are

136
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:31,740
built in defaults. Some useful
tools for exploring the

137
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,700
different possible licenses you
might want to use. creative

138
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,690
comments has a website that goes
through kind of the different

139
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,740
creative commons license says
including the CC zero public

140
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,020
domain license and the variants
of the CC by which include

141
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:54,600
requirements, for instance, for
attribution, or not letting

142
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,190
people create derivatives of the
work. Software, again is

143
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,280
different, there are different
licenses for software. So

144
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,900
hopefully, this table gives you
a brief guide to some of these

145
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,440
possible licenses. And then the
websites themselves have more

146
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:17,220
detailed information that are
useful for you. Again, more

147
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,590
resources, if you would like to
learn more about this very

148
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:29,910
complex legal Lee's topic in
detail. But I will just sum up

149
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,550
this content in that you if
you're building a open project,

150
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,090
and you want others to build off
of your work and use it, you

151
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,440
need a license. And that license
is going to be this top level

152
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,770
file whose name is license. If
you have code and data in

153
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,980
different content in your
project, you will want to use a

154
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:59,040
different license for those
different types of content. And

155
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,940
then some good permissive
defaults, if you're working with

156
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,440
code is to share a code using
the MIT license. If you are

157
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,930
sharing writing or documents or
images, the CC by license or for

158
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,650
data that you use the CC zero
license, which effectively puts

159
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,850
it into public domain
