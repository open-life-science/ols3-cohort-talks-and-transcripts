1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,670
Georgia Aitkenhead: I'm here to talk about
participator in citizen science,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,470
which are two very closely
related scientific methods that

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,290
are very valuable wind, and I
think also quite productive

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,660
towards open research and open
science. And I'm here with some

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,180
citizen scientists who are
working with me on the project,

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,830
Suzanne, who I owe to Smith and
Sarah Markham, they're all

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,260
fantastic contributors, they're
autistic. And they're going to

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,340
talk to you in more detail about
their experiences and areas of

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,800
expertise. So just to go through
some very brief explanations.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,550
Citizen Science basically
involves any science and which

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,880
people who are non professional
scientists take part. Many of

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,970
you may be familiar with
zooniverse, or open source

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,630
funding. These are ones that
target very particular parts of

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,380
the research cycle.
participatory science is in many

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,020
respects a more stringent
requirement. It means that the

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,580
people for whom there is most at
stake in the research are

17
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,850
involved in empowered positions
and directing directions,

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,780
setting positions. So not just
consultants, and not just doing

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,440
some part of the process without
knowing why they have to be

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,360
informed and they have to be
able to direct it. I think this

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,520
is really important for breaking
down the boundary between the

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,400
knower and the known. And as
Sarah will talk about later,

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,830
there are some really good
reasons why we need to be very

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,480
careful as researchers and
scientists about thinking we

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,780
know more than we do, and not
listening to the subjects very

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,160
search. And as I said before,
all of these methods go

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,010
together. So I'm working on
building a citizen science

28
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,310
project currently, which has
been co created with members of

29
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,340
the autistic community to
investigate sensory processing

30
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,510
and autism. The participatory
research aspect brings autistic

31
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,110
people in at every stage of the
research process from so it

32
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,350
started with the James Lind
Alliance setting, priority

33
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,470
setting exercise which consulted
more than 1000 autistic people

34
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,850
about what questions needed to
be answered by autism research,

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,830
citizen science allows it to be
scaled and reach more people. So

36
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,160
a citizen science platform means
that it's not as intensive in

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,400
terms of one to one researcher
time. And open source

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,810
development is a wonderful way
of creating the transparency

39
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,750
that you need for participatory
science to be meaningful, as

40
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,890
well, as has we've been
discussing before in this

41
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,100
session. It allows you to
collaborate with all of these

42
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,890
incredible experts around the
world who can give you their

43
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,620
experience too. So now, Dr.
Sarah Markham, who is a

44
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,460
researcher herself, as well as
having lived experience with

45
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,510
autism, he is going to talk
about why participatory science

46
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,620
is important in relation to
heuristics in autism research.

47
00:02:52,950 --> 00:03:24,870
So if he is there, do we have
Sarah here? Sarah, Marco. You do

48
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,860
now I was mute. I was muted.
Okay, that sounds a mystery.

49
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:29,670
Alright.

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,130
It's quite ironic that the worst
heuristic is in the title when

51
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,970
research has shown that autistic
people themselves are less

52
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,340
susceptible to many of the
biases that more neurotypical

53
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,220
people are capable of. But but
that's the presentation in hand.

54
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,250
Yes, changing approaches to
autism research. It's gone from,

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,750
you know, viewing, you know,
the, the the autistic person.

56
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,670
While a little Professor model
of Hans Asperger, we've

57
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,240
progressed onto the autistic
spectrum, looking at a multi

58
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,920
dimensional approach to autism.
And now we're now we have the

59
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,760
autism constellation model,
which kind of looks like a

60
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,360
crossover between a woodwork
project and string theory. We

61
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,480
can look at those dimensions
being curled up and perhaps

62
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,360
sometimes unfurling and, and
then curling up again. But the

63
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,320
exciting thing about
participatory science is that

64
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,700
it's a form of action research,
where the people the subjects

65
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,240
themselves are, in a way,
actually doing the science and

66
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,750
setting the protocols and
changing the protocols. They're

67
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,710
doing the versioning themselves
as they progress through the

68
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,390
scientific journey. So we're
kind of experiencing a paradigm

69
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:00,300
shift by this participatory
science approach. Thanks A way

70
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,650
of challenging conventional
static means of conducting

71
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,830
science, it's making it a more
agile, adaptive, evolutionary

72
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,690
approach. And it kind of will
hopefully help, in that sense

73
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,740
disperse some of the rigid
stereotypes around autistic

74
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,000
people. That's me.

75
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:35,280
Fabulous. Thank you, Sara. Um,
so I'm going to talk in a little

76
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,970
bit more detail about this
specific program, then myself,

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,790
see Sarah notice have all been
working on with a number of

78
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,710
other people. So this is on
spaces, and it's currently being

79
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,450
prototyped. And basically, it's
a website where autistic people

80
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,710
can share experiences of their
daily lives. And knows

81
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,740
experiences will then be used to
understand more about sensory

82
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,100
processing differences. So
around 90%, depending on the

83
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,730
study of autistic people have
sensory processing differences.

84
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,870
And it's sometimes been used as
a criteria of diagnosing autism,

85
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,100
although that fluctuates.
There's lots of lab based

86
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,580
studies into this. But there's
very little around how this

87
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,630
actually affects autistic people
and impact on their lives. And

88
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,670
so the idea is to use this data
set to pull out some common

89
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,090
themes, but also get a sense of
the diversity, and the

90
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,260
individual, like the granularity
of those range of experiences,

91
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,870
and use those to make
environments more accessible to

92
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,670
autistic people. For example, by
changing public policy modifying

93
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,900
environments, one thing I did
want to call your attention to,

94
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,620
in particular about this
platform is that the uses of

95
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,840
fine grained consent model. So
every single user can choose who

96
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,050
they share their experience
with, and for what purpose,

97
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,020
whether it's for research, or
published on the platform, or

98
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,450
both. And it's a dynamic consent
model as well. So they will be

99
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:10,710
able to withdraw their data
when, whenever they want, and

100
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,320
put it back as many times as
they like. And also, there's a

101
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,780
moderation process that is being
developed along with this

102
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,150
platform with artistic citizen
science scientists. So instead

103
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,690
of these things being imposed on
autistic people, by researchers,

104
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,530
this is really coming from the
autistic population, because

105
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,600
they know the most about their
own experiences. Um, this looks

106
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,100
a very busy slide. But it's I
think, for me, this is a lot of

107
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,010
the whole range of possibilities
that participatory citizen

108
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,750
science can. So one of the
things that I did in the last

109
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,840
lls cohort, because I did
cohort, too. And I can see

110
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,630
Katharina is here, actually, as
well, he's also been working

111
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,990
with me on the project. So hope
you're enjoying your life, I

112
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,830
learned a lot from it. This is
the kind of mapping exercise

113
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,100
that I did, and trying to work
out what all of the skills and

114
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,640
resources that were needed for
the platform were. And it was

115
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,010
important that autistic people
were involved in every single

116
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,330
aspect, as well as every part of
the research stage. So you can

117
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,520
see that this kind of circle
here, the yellow, it's artistic

118
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,280
people have been involved in
literally every part of this,

119
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,340
from hypothesizing, designing
the experiment, processing,

120
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,750
data, drawing, conclusions, and
so on. And also, as well as

121
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,420
lived experience, of course,
artistic people are people,

122
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,900
they're individuals with their
own unique skill sets. So a huge

123
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,010
amount of how the project has
been designed, is around those

124
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,510
unique skill sets, you can see
here, there's a whole range of

125
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,420
people being matched to skills,
including platform development.

126
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,360
We're entirely open source, the
protocols actually are all

127
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,300
published in a repository. And
it's available for reuse. were

128
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,340
linked into the train way and
amongst other things. So you're

129
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,430
welcome to join. If you're
interested, anyone can come

130
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,930
along. You can see here that
actually, open source knows my

131
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,870
research can work with people
who are not familiar with

132
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,380
GitHub, but are interested in
the project. So these are two

133
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,870
examples of working with
community members who are

134
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,290
citizen scientists to design
aspects of the project. The

135
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:27,450
first one is guidance on looking
through data and understanding

136
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,770
what you might want to remove,
or what you might think about

137
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,720
when you're deciding whether you
want something to be published

138
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,740
or not. When I wrote it was
these really academic jargony

139
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,860
paragraphs. And this is a
collaborator called James Scott,

140
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,230
who just broke it down into
these really beautiful,

141
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,640
extremely simple point by point
steps. And on the other side,

142
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,860
you see something that I was
working on with Sue, who I'm

143
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,850
going to pass over to in a
moment. This is a color coded

144
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,290
version of tasks that people can
do on GitHub from easy to

145
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,080
difficult so the green is You
may not have that much

146
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,470
experience, the read is you have
to be pretty advanced. And those

147
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,290
are now the labeling system for
all the issues on GitHub right

148
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,460
now based on C's design, to make
it more accessible for autistic

149
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,780
people. And so now I'm going to
pass over to sue. And she will

150
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,420
talk about her experience for a
little bit. And then after that,

151
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,120
I'll pass it over to Otis. So
over tc,

152
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:28,230
Hi, I'm Sue UI. And I turned 67
on Monday, and I was an HR

153
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,960
admin, but non digital
engagement of any kind, and

154
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,600
scientists were scientists and
people were people, and never

155
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,950
the twain should meet. So I been
involved in the focus groups and

156
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,140
stuff, I can actually totally
relate to what Sarah was talking

157
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,800
about the constellations because
my birth chart comes across as a

158
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,140
splash chart. So I have a
smattering of all sorts of

159
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,500
different things, including
creativity as opposed to

160
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,650
wordsmith. I'm great at
community engagement,

161
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,710
proofreading, newsletters, that
sort of stuff. So I was involved

162
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,010
with the focus groups, and they
moved on to the point where we

163
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,610
were developing the digital
platform without spaces, and

164
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,910
found myself learning this
different language and possibly,

165
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,940
Georgian, everyone learning
about my accessibility language.

166
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,570
Well, I'm reiterating things
from my birth my autistic

167
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,420
community, and my work was my
local Borough Council, London

168
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,180
Borough of Hammersmith and
Fulham. So, you know, doing this

169
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,300
stuff the labels was was great,
but also having the meetups

170
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,320
every fortnight where we invite
anyone who's worked on it with

171
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,590
us so far, and then new people
to collaborate with us. We've

172
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,640
purpose is it once a fortnight
so I've expanded my Twitter

173
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,680
account exponentially, I'm using
my protein everything to try and

174
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,280
hook people in. So some of the
people that I'm working with in

175
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,870
the OT space meetups are either
the scientists working both at

176
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:52,530
university level and new people.
So we supportive of everybody's

177
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,260
ability to be inclusive, and
accessibility is really

178
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,310
important. Because we don't make
it accessible the data input,

179
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,390
then we've nothing to extract.
And I'm actually in a new music

180
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,230
position, I work in the end game
with my borough, doing a new

181
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,820
Civic campus and public realm.
So I'm putting into practice my

182
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,250
influence on ambient
environment. And when those

183
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,540
buildings and public realm, I'll
be able to feed in data from my

184
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,540
experience navigating these
environments to add to the

185
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,780
platform. And it's that
reiterative kind of approach of

186
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,260
adding and building layers that
will make our stuff I think,

187
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,150
profoundly groundbreaking. And
I'm really grateful to be a part

188
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,870
of it. And today, I actually in
a different event, I take part

189
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,880
in a human library, which I can
send resource to someone, I was

190
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,630
being read as a as an autistic
book by someone from purposes in

191
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,450
their PR wing in London, and
they do a lot of clinical trials

192
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:54,150
with autism. So when I mentioned
our work on ot spaces, all the

193
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,360
pens came out, everyone started
writing stuff down. So I'm

194
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,620
looking forward to maybe seeing
some of the purposes, language,

195
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,410
perhaps joining in in the
future. So thank you for the

196
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,120
opportunity to speak with you
this evening.

197
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,370
Wonderful, thank you so much. So
you see the thing absolutely

198
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,360
amazing. And so as artists who
has been part of the project

199
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,670

going to hand over to him now.

200
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,540
And just to let you all know,
everybody is welcome to join the

201

204
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,580
Hello, good evening for the
year. Hello, my name is Otis

205
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,840
Smith. I'm part of the citizen
science project and one of the

206
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,310
many countries about this budget
I myself have been autistic

207
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,300
since the age of 15. One of the
main parts of the project was

208
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,350
the opportunity and potential to
try and create a space for

209
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,310
autistic people that works,
appeals and benefits to all as

210
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,670
well as coordinating, expanding
the project further implanting

211
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,660
new skills, tools and resources,
thinking of different ways and

212
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,400
strategies to make the platform
authentic, accessible, engaging,

213
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,940
and interactive as possible.
Being a part of the citizen

214
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,090
science project has given me a
complete whole new meaning

215
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,770
outlook and purpose to improve
and be better. What I enjoy

216
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,050
about being included in the
citizen science project is that

217
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,900
everyone has their own take, and
contribution no matter how big

218
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,650
or small. Each take comes with
its own challenges as well as

219
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,430
discoveries implement a new
slicer questions and advice was

220
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,600
used in several effective
techniques and expertise and

221
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,660
having the opportunity to meet
and work alongside others

222
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,130
discussing agendas to sharing
new and effective ideas. It's

223
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,400
been such a privilege to be part
of this project. It's changed at

224
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,230
time. challenge my thoughts and
perceptions, reassessing and re

225
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,070
evaluating different topics and
strategies has been eye opening

226
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,820
and fulfilling at the same time.
This isn't science, but it

227
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,460
displays such depth into
character and representation of

228
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,710
the aims and does not look at
things in an unrealistic

229
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,830
approach to great players find
we want to ensure that the work

230
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,710
we put in can have such a
positive impact and make a

231
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,620
different reward for me. It's
not that the work we have

232
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,700
countries can hopefully expand.
Now it's not just a few, but the

233
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,320
money. Thank you.

234
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,940
Fabulous, thank you. Thank you
