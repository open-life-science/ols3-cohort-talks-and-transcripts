00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Esther Plomp: My name is Esther
Plomp. I'm a data steward at the

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,380
Delft University of Technology
in the Netherlands. And I'm also

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,210
one of the mentors of this
cohort. And you can find the

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,020
link of this presentation in the
slide itself. And I should have

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,910
also pasted the link in the
notes. So do let me know if you

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:30,030
cannot access it. So open data.
What is open data? Open Data is

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,810
any data that's made freely
available for use and reuse by

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,920
anyone and everyone. So what
does that mean? It means that

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,680
everyone should have access to
the data. So it should be

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,940
available on the internet, for
anyone to access on demand.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,280
Everyone must be able to use
reuse and redistribute that

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,020
data. So participation is also
very important here. It should

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,680
also be transparent what kind of
information or what kind of open

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,890
data you're accessing. So there
should be some information about

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,430
data generation, and collection
and about the data. In terms of

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,970
reuse and distribution, that's
very important for open data,

17
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,770
you should be able to
redistribute data without a lot

18
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,580
of restrictions. And we'll get
back to that later. And open

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,940
data should also be
interoperable. And that means

20
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,860
that you can integrate it or
link it to other data. And if

21
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,700
you do that, in a machine
readable format, it's easy to do

22
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,080
that automatically. So these
definitions are from the Open

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,710
Data handbook and the World
Bank, and I pasted those things

24
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,160
in the slides. So do have a look
at those websites. If you want

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,140
to learn more about the
terminology. What is open data

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,050
and not or? Yeah, just to
highlight that the sentence data

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,160
will be available upon request
is not a good sign in terms of

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,990
open data. So I'm sure we've all
seen this sentence in a

29
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,070
publication where the author
states that sure if you email

30
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,060
me, or if you call me, I will
provide you the data. So it does

31
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,300
not open because you can't
actually access it by yourself,

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,120
you would have to go through the
author. And a study by vines and

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,560
colleagues has indicated that is
not as easy as it sounds, you

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,700
can email researchers. But
because we tend to hop

35
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,130
institutes, we change our email
addresses quite frequently. So a

36
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,430
lot of the time, it's going to
be difficult to contact a

37
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,680
researcher. So their conclusion
in their paper was then also

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,030
that research data cannot be
reliably preserved by individual

39
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:54,360
researchers, which might sound a
bit harsh. But to be fair, I

40
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,720
don't think we should be asking
individual researchers to

41
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,050
preserve data for the long term.
That's why we have data

42
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:09,090
repositories. What is also not
open data is fair data. So this

43
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,690
is a term that's been used
increasingly in the data world.

44
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,580
But it's actually not the same
as having data that is open. So

45
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,330
fair, means findable,
accessible, interoperable and

46
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,650
reusable. And what does that
practically mean? I put some

47
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,000
links into the slide, where you
can look it up in detail. But

48
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,290
I'm going to do it very briefly
right now. So finable means that

49
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:40,110
your data is finable on a data
repository with some metadata,

50
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,670
so information about the data,
and a persistent identifier. And

51
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,630
this persistent identifier
ensures that you do not end up

52
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,810
with a broken link. So that
means that your data is going to

53
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,960
be accessible as well. So
accessible, is seems kind of

54
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,430
like it's open. But that's not
actually what's accessible in

55
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,910
the word fair is about
accessible means that there's a

56
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,960
procedure in place that allows
you to obtain access to the

57
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,160
data, potentially, but your X's
can still be declined, but there

58
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,970
should be a procedure in place.
So this is where it's different

59
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,840
from open data is not
necessarily open. It can be but

60
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,910
not necessarily. But here also
we see that interoperable plays

61
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,860
an important part of fair and
your data is interoperable when

62
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,600
you use open formats, so formats
that anyone can use such as PDF.

63
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,100
Instead of Word documents, for
example, not everyone has a word

64
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,250
license and can just use that
software. But also, if you use

65
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,230
commonly use vocabulary or
standards to describe your data,

66
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,760
that means it's more easy to
integrate it with other data and

67
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,530
more easily understandable for
others. Same goes for reusable.

68
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,340
If you want your data to be
reusable, you should document it

69
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,840
well, so that others can
interpret the data. And in order

70
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,350
to do that it has already been
mentioned for software. But the

71
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,970
same goes for data, you can set
up a readme file, and I put put

72
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,190
two examples of README files in
the presentation. So do please

73
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:28,440
have a look if you want an
example. And also, there are

74
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,080
things such as data
dictionaries, or code books,

75
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,250
there's a little bit more
elaborate in comparison to the

76
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,670
readme file. But it's also very
good practice to document your

77
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:44,370
data so that others can actually
reuse it. And then, what is also

78
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,390
the same for data as for code,
in order for it to be reusable,

79
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:55,560
you need a license. And for
data, the most commonly used

80
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,270
licenses are the Creative
Commons licenses. So we do use

81
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,330
different licenses than
software. Because data and

82
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,920
software are different objects,
it functions a little bit

83
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,920
different. So I would not
recommend using the Creative

84
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,910
Commons license for software.
But for data, this is standard

85
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,010
practice. And the licensed use
of our software was already

86
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,150
linked before this, I'm actually
linking to the same one, because

87
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,830
it's a very nice website. But
for data, we now also have a

88
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,900
licensed user. So you can go to
the link in the slides to check

89
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,290
that out. So just briefly, also
introduced whether licenses is

90
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,920
basically a sort of standardized
contracts, that tells anyone

91
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,600
what they can do with your data.
So they don't have to ask you

92
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,290
what you allow them to do with
it. And as actually why it's

93
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,230
very important to have this
license out there in the open.

94
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,860
Because if your data or your
software doesn't have a license,

95
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,960
it means no one can actually use
it without asking you. So this

96
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:10,740
is why it's very important to
have that license. I'm getting

97
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,000
distracted by I'm not looking at
that right now. Sorry, we'll get

98
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,720
through it later, hopefully.
Right, open data has cc zero or

99
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,370
CC by licenses. This means that
there is no law of restrictions

100
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,140
for every user of your data. So
for example, cc zero or the

101
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,670
public domain allows the user to
do basically anything with your

102
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,030
data. And they don't even have
to attribute you. So they don't

103
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,660
necessarily have to cite you.
Does good practice, though. So I

104
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,500
would recommend the Cite your
sources. But if you would like

105
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,820
to enforce that a bit more, you
could use the CC by license. So

106
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,390
that allows the same things as
you can see in the slides as the

107
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,410
public domain. But it also
ensures that every year should,

108
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,150
should cite you or credit you.
And then the further down you go

109
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,510
with these licenses, you see
that they get a little bit more

110
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,280
restrictive. So for example, the
CC by non commercial non

111
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,560
derivative, the one at the very
bottom of this list, that one

112
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,570
does allows you to copy and
publish the data, but it doesn't

113
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,800
allow for commercial use, and
you can't actually modify and

114
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,820
adapt it. So this is not really
open data in a sense, because

115
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,410
there's a lot of restrictions
that are placed on the data. But

116
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,260
in any case, if you want to
choose that licensed that is of

117
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,310
course, up to you. And also just
a highlight here. If you're not

118
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,310
sure what license to choose for
your project and you want to

119
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,540
share data, please also feel
free to contact me if you just

120
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:57,540
want to ask or just have a chat
about it. And then something

121
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,080
which I find very important is
that it's not just about the

122
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,140
access to the data and
redistributing the data.

123
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,710
So I pasted two of my favorite
quotes regarding Open Science on

124
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,060
the slide, which is that there
is no Open Science if science is

125
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,640
not open to all. And that's a
quote from the blog post. Bro

126
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,930
open science is broken science
and can recommend to read that

127
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,760
one. And also the quotes
including more ways of knowing

128
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,670
and understanding our common
World Within the great

129
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,480
scientific conversation would
enrich and diversify its

130
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,980
collective ideas and creativity
for the common good. And that

131
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,090
quote is from open science
beyond open access, and that's a

132
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,590
report which I also highly
recommend that you read. So it's

133
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,160
really not just about having
access to things. I think open

134
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,500
data is really about anyone
allowing to participate in the

135
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,090
creation and generation of the
data as well, because otherwise,

136
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,400
I don't think it's truly open.
And if you want to learn more

137
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,080
about that, there's the data
equity framework by we'll count.

138
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,810
And there is a webinar on data
justice talk story, which I

139
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:24,480
recommend and a book on data
feminism by Catherine de Ignacio

140
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,590
and Lau and clay. So they go a
little bit more into the topic

141
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:34,500
on why it's important that
everyone can participate. And

142
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,310
then I also listed some
additional resources. bola

143
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,640
Anthony Martinez gave a similar
presentation to this one last

144
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,510
year for core two, and it's a
really good presentation. So do

145
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:51,300
have a look. And if you want to
really participate in open data,

146
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,540
and you want to get more
involved, I can recommend

147
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,660
joining the research data
Alliance, which is a global

148
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:03,570
research community that really
wants to increase awareness and

149
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,370
facilitate sharing of data. So
this is a great way to get in

150
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,330
touch with colleagues, and get
involved to initiatives and

151
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,840
working groups and do some
really practical stuff, as well

152
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,460
in terms of data sharing, of
course, during way, already been

153
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,880
highlighted. But it has an open
research or reproducible

154
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,970
research chapter. So you can
also find more information

155
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,560
there. And the open data, open
data Handbook, by the Open

156
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,910
Knowledge Foundation. And then
if you you're running out of

157
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,240
time, and you don't want to read
full data, books, and

158
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,980
presentations and all these
things, I listed two blocks 10

159
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,670
arguments against open science
