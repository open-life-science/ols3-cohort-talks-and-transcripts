1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Unknown: Hi, everyone. So first
of all, let me just open this by

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,280
saying that I am not an agile
expert. These are just some

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,750
techniques that I that I tend to
use, often on my day to day.

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,249
And, and we will explain a
little bit what this is and how

5
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:20,729
you can benefit from using this.
So first of all, what is

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,950
ajl? So AJ was a bit of a
principle or a framework to to

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,300
organize and structure projects,
it's, let's let's, let's call it

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,860
a project manager, or project
project management technique.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,930
If if you're one of these people
that tend to have a lot of posts

10
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,990
around with tasks to do, and so
on, you're probably already even

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,870
using some of the techniques
that the Agile movement

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,530
inspires.

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,290
But to perhaps keep it a bit
more focused on the point. So

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,980
agile is something that started
in industry,

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,050
it was mostly driven by an
intention to deliver a good

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,070
product to,

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,110
to the customers, but at the
same time to deliver that

18
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,220
product as quickly as possible,
even if in a prototype state.

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,010
But at the same time, allowing
to,

20
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,190
again, as quick as possible,
adapt and modify the product to

21
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,730
better fit the needs of the
client. And so as you can kind

22
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,960
of, you can kind of see from
from just the ajl software

23
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,720
development manifest. And this
was, as I said, was something

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,630
that started in the industry,
but specifically in the software

25
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,330
world. And, and the kind of like
striking point, and the reason

26
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,310
why it's called a jail is is in
part because of this. Want, I

27
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,980
don't know if you can see my
mouse cursor malvika? Can you

28
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,630
maybe give me a thumbs up? No.
Okay.

29
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,510
Then let's see if I can do

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,530
this.

31
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,140
Can you see it now?

32
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah.

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,220
So so what I was pointing to is
responding to change, this was

34
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,840
one of the aspects that

35
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,020
kind of motivated to give this
name to, to the movement or to

36
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,750
the framework, and a trial in
the sense of being very fast and

37
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,490
kind of responsive to, to
requests and changes. And so you

38
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,250
might, if you if you look a
little bit into what these, this

39
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,420
framework consists of, or if you
compare it with other kind of

40
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,460
approaches that people use in
the field,

41
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,190
you may encounter these these
words, waterfall. And you might

42
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,060
find also

43
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,420
other names for this kind of
iterative process. There's many,

44
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,240
many different ways that you can
structure this.

45
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,820
And I'll explain a few in in a
second. But if you just look at

46
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,240
the waterfall kind of concept,
you can, you can see that it it

47
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,500
falls from one stage to the
next. The key point here is that

48
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,060
all of the project plan is kind
of defined from the beginning.

49
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,180
And you just follow along in a
screen in a sequential fashion.

50
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,390
So you can imagine that, if at
any point during design, or at

51
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,460
any point during the
implementation, or one of the

52
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,070
later stages, there's something
that you need to change about

53
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,640
the plan. This process is rather
rigid and doesn't really allow

54
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,960
this. And so the iterative
process is a bit more generic or

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,640
a bit more responsive,

56
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,310
it typically starts by breaking
a larger problem into smaller

57
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,420
chunks, so that they become more
actionable. Exactly what small

58
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,890
means. This is what differs a
lot between different paradigms,

59
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,680
but it can be something that
lasts a day, it can be something

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,240
that lasts a few hours. And then
you you do these kinds of

61
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,750
sprints, or you aggregate these
tasks into milestones. And, and

62
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,840
once each milestone is
completed, then you reach a

63
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,310
stage where where you have like
a first release or a prototype

64
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,730
of the thing that you're trying
to accomplish. In the case of

65
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,540
your or less project, it can be
a milestone, for instance, you

66
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,800
have a website to build. And you
can think how to break the that

67
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,480
big task into smaller chunks.
And it could be the first

68
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,110
article that you write could be
the an example of a first

69
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:22,680
deliverable.

70
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,560
And so to sum it up, it's a
technique primarily for software

71
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,170
development, but we can use it
elsewhere. And we can go a

72
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,190
little bit more into detail of
how to actually do that. It's

73
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,360
it's great for product project
management, it helps you

74
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,110
visualize the work that you
still have to do, and also to

75
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,420
invite others to join the
project as well because

76
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,300
everything is very visible in
terms of what needs to be done

77
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,680
and what has been done. And then
there's lots that there's lots

78
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,970
of variations in terms of how

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,290
This is structured, and also in
terms of advantages over the

80
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,190
traditional waterfall method. So
So I mentioned breaking down

81
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,660
things into tasks and smart and
milestones and so on. And I

82
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,190
mentioned as well that you could
aim for slices of one to two

83
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,660
hours, ideally, not more than a
day or two. The reason for this

84
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,110
fragmentation is because you
want to have a good a good sense

85
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,920
of, of progress, it's very often
the case that you estimate a

86
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,710
task to be one or two hours. And
then it turns out to do spend an

87
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,860
entire afternoon or something
because we get distracted,

88
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,830
because there's other things
that we didn't really think. And

89
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,760
the idea here is that the Agile
movement will help you structure

90
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,510
those things that are outside of
the tasks that you're doing. And

91
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,420
they just become tasks again,
that will get picked up later,

92
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,650
and move to a milestone that you
will complete at a later stage.

93
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,970
And so to give you a more
concrete example, or a real life

94
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,570
example,

95
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,830
if if you have already explored
a little bit of GitHub, and if

96
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,640
you've perhaps browsed some of
the existing projects there, you

97
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,920
might see project like inter
mine, where in this in this

98
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,640
diagram, each of these gray
boxes is

99
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,410
sorry, for the background noise.
Each of these back each of these

100
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,260
gray boxes is a version release.

101
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:29,610
And the tasks themselves are
within each of these gray boxes.

102
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,220
And in this case, milestones,
there are several them, you can

103
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,940
see already some estimate of
when these would be achieved.

104
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,430
And, and, and also a very
colorful interface for for how

105
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,020
the how to label things and how
to structure not just in terms

106
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,900
of milestones, but also in terms
of what these tasks are, are all

107
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,350
about.

108
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,400
In a in a slightly different way
or a more

109
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,860
kind of so one of the cons, one
of the paradigms in a job or a

110
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,960
more popular one, if you've used

111
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,570
the Kanban style board where
instead of having

112
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,960
the versions like or the
milestones, as we mentioned

113
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,920
before, you have just the notion
of what what is to be done, what

114
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,130
is in progress and what is
already completed. So this is

115
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,940
like a simplified version is not
so focused on one software or

116
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:30,270
versions or specific milestones
or goals. But it's more to

117
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,350
capture what is actually being
active worked on. And and you

118
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,920
could do this process within a
milestone. So all of the tasks

119
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,010
that you now see in the screen
could be within one milestone

120
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,620
alone. This alters this, also to
say that for GitHub, there's

121
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,970
some simplifications and some
automation that you can do. And

122
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,080
you we can we can talk about
that later if you're interested.

123
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,650
And so just to wrap up some
examples, you could have a task

124
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,830
that is just to acquire like in
the website context that I

125
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,640
mentioned before, one, one big
task could be to acquire a

126
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,490
domain for that website. And
then you can see an example of

127
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,840
how to break that task down into
smaller tasks. Or if you have a

128
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,290
specific section of the website
that you want to create. And

129
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,530
then you can see that for that
there's perhaps more tasks that

130
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,140
need to be completed. And so
ideally, you would break it down

131
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,320
again, into into subsequently
smaller steps.

132
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:38,160
I will skip this for for the
sake of time. And I didn't go so

133
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,890
much into the jargon that is
involved, I mentioned that

134
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,340
there's different sub
frameworks, Scrum, Kanban. And

135
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,420
Extreme Programming are some
examples of these. They all

136
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,140
follow the the Agile principles,
what changes between them is

137
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,530
sometimes how big these tasks
are, how big the milestones are,

138
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,790
how often you you kind of do the
the larger loop or the smaller

139
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,930
loop for how long you do these
things called sprints, which is

140
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,570
kind of a way of getting the
entire group working

141
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,430
collectively in a set of tasks.
And, and then just how you

142
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,240
structure but so without going
too much into detail on that is

143
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,990
just different ways of handling
the workload and in prioritizing

144
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:25,200
the tasks that you have to do.
And, and then to finalize, even

145
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,080
though as I tried to be very
superficial here as well, to

146
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,530
kind of give a high level
introduction to this to this

147
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,610
topic. If you're if you're doing
software development, you will

148
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,480
find that all of this probably
translates a lot more versions,

149
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,780
milestones and so on. This kind
of makes sense. But I I use this

150
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,290
personally for it for my own day
to day just to manage tasks that

151
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,400
I have to do things like
reporting or planning meetings

152
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,810
or anything, anything of this
sort and and I find that it

153
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,890
works rather well.
